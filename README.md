**Reel Composer** is a "Director's Studio" that transforms raw talking-head footage into high-retention "Edutainment" content (Instagram Reels / TikToks / YouTube Shorts). 

It leverages **Google Gemini 2.0/2.5** to intelligently analyze your transcript and generate synchronized, broadcast-quality HTML5/GSAP animations that overlay your video.

## 🧠 The Philosophy: Quantity > Perfectionism

> *"In the world of algorithms, Volume is Leverage."*

To grow on social media, you must understand the **Statistics of Virality**.

### 1. The Probabilistic Reality
Going viral is a probabilistic event. It is a lottery where every video you post is a ticket. 
*   **Low Volume:** Posting 1 "Perfect" video a month = 12 chances/year.
*   **High Volume:** Posting 1 "Good Enough" video a day = 365 chances/year.

### 2. The Credibility Trap
Usually, increasing volume means sacrificing quality. However, low-quality content hurts your authority (Credibility). 
*   **The Dilemma:** High-end motion graphics (Edutainment) build trust but take days to edit in After Effects.
*   **The Solution:** **Reel Composer** automates the "Credibility Layer."

### 3. Automating Authority
This tool bridges the gap. It allows you to produce **High-Retention, Visually Intellectual Content** at the **Volume** required for statistical growth.

*   **Don't compromise on Credibility.**
*   **Don't compromise on Volume.**
*   **Let AI handle the pixels.**

## 🎬 The "Pro" Workflow

To achieve the highest quality output, follow this content creation pipeline:

### 1. Record & Clean
Record your video. If you are recording in a noisy environment, pass your audio through **[Adobe Podcast Enhance](https://podcast.adobe.com/enhance)** to get studio-quality sound.

### 2. Transcribe (.SRT)
Generative AI needs context. Convert your video/audio into an SRT subtitle file.
*   *Recommended Tool:* **[Transcri.io](https://transcri.io/en/subtitle-generator/srt)** or standard video editing software.

### 3. Compose (This App)
1.  **Upload:** Drop your Video and SRT file into Reel Composer.
2.  **Director's Brief:** (Optional) Describe the visual context (e.g., "I want a cyberpunk grid appearing when I say 'Matrix'").
3.  **Generate:** The app uses Gemini to generate a custom HTML animation layer and a dynamic split-screen layout JSON.

### 4. Refine with LLMs
The built-in editor allows you to tweak the code.
*   *Workflow Tip:* If the animation isn't quite right, copy the generated code, paste it into **ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini**, and say: *"Make the particles faster"* or *"Change the color to green"*. Paste the updated code back into the Editor Panel.

### 5. Export
Record the final composition directly from the browser to get a polished `.webm` or `.mp4` file ready for social media.
*   *Recommended Tool:* **[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)** or standard screen recording software to capture the playback.
